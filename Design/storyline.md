# Storyline

## Introduction
Revie is a short and simple RPG set in 1980's style adventure game world.  Probably a lot like phantasy star (sega master system) cuz that's the RPG I enjoyed the most as a kid.


## Main plot
As the main character, you lost a family member and you're tryin to find them.  At the start, you only have a few clues and items to go on.  The clues lead you around to find some basic items, do some leveling up, collect more information about your lost family member, and ultimatley uncover a more complicated plot. In the end, you find your lost family member and all is well.


## More complicated plot
Your family member got involved with the wrong people and is being held captive in a jail on a remote island. It's up to you to get to the island and rescue them.
