WELCOME TO ZORK!

ZORK is a game of adventure, danger, and low cunning. In it you will explore some of the most amazing territory ever seen by mortals. No computer should be without one!

WELCOME TO FSLAMP!

FSLAMP is a homage to the original text adventure games like ZORK, but mostly an excuse to write a console game in F# using .NET Core.

Type _help_ to see some of the basic commands possible.
