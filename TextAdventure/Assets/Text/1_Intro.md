A moment ago you were just in bed floating above your mind, dreaming about how to add zebras to spreadsheets (unsuccessfully).  Woken, it appears you've been brought to an unfamiliar dimlit room. With blurred vision, unfamiliar sounds and smells lurk around you. Anxious to figure out how such an event could've occurred, you gather your bits and begin to focus your senses on a common goal.
