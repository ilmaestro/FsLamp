# FsLamp

FsLamp is a text adventure engine written in F#. It was developed out of a learning project meant to improve F# skills, game design skills, and hopefully pave the path towards future game development and natural language processing. In this talk we'll take a look at the game engine implementation and learn how to write interactive fiction games in F#.
